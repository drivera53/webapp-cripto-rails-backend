# React - Flatcoin Back End
Welcome to React - FlatCoin! This App was develop as a Flatiron School React project. I developed this app to help users practice trading cryptocurrencies using virtual (fake) money.

# Installation
Fork this back end repository and Install all of the required gems: (If you run into issues try deleting `Gemfile.lock` and then `bundle install` again.)
```ruby
bundle install
```
If you want to start with a fresh new database you may delete `development.sqlite` and `schema.rb`; then run:
```ruby
rails db:migrate
```
Make sure to fork its [front end repository](https://github.com/drivera53/react-flatcoin) as well.

# Usage
Run `rails s` or `rails server -p 3001` if you're currently using port 3000 in your front end.
